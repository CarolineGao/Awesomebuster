# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
#one: {}
# column: value
#
#two: {}
#  column: value


# 17-Dec-2015 CAROLINE modified: grayed # one: {} and # two: {}, for the rake test errors.
